## ESlint

[ESlint](https://eslint.org/) - Has been used during developement and had no errors.

![ESlint](/documentation/Eslint.png)

In the ContactForm.js and in the useEffect hook dependencies array I had to disable-next-line. If contactData is included in the dependency array,
the useEffect hook will run indefinitely, so I had to remove it.

```javascript
 useEffect(() => {
    if (currentUser) {
      // If the current user exists, fetch the user profile data.
      const fetchProfileData = async () => {
        try {
          const { data } = await axiosReq.get(`/profiles/${id}/`);
          // Set the contactData state with the user's name and email address.
          setContactData({
            ...contactData,
            name: currentUser.username,
            email: data.email_address,
          });
        } catch (err) {
          // console.log(err);
        }
      };
      fetchProfileData();
    }
    // if contactData is included in the dependency array,
    // the useEffect hook will run indefinitely
    // eslint-disable-next-line
  }, [id, history]);

```

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

BUG: When press add to list button and then remove from list, The button wouldn't change state.

FIX: I had to add in the useEffect array the addedToList variable to be able to change the boolean/statement to True|

___

BUG: When edit form get the following warning in the console : ProfileEditForm.js:46 Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function at ProfileEditForm

Fix: After chatting with student support we realise that the call to setProfileData was causing the issue, as it's being called after the component unmounts,  the solution was to create a ref :

 ```javascript
 const profileDataSet = useRef(false)
 ```

and update my useEffect hook with an if statement:

```javascript
if (!profileDataSet.current) {`
            `setProfileData({`
              `first_name,`
              `last_name,`
              `email_address,`
              `image,`
              `phone,`
            `});`
            `profileDataSet.current = true;`
          `}`
```

___
BUG: After updating a listing and redirecting to `history.push(/listings/${data.id});` the old images would be rendered.

FIX:

```javascript
window.localstorage.setItem("edited", true);` in `handleSubmit()` to ListingEditForm.js
```

and  then in ListingsPage.js add

```javascript
if (window.localStorage.getItem("edited") === "true") { window.location.reload(); localStorage.removeItem("edited");}
```

___
BUG: It wouldn't get the refresh token, when refresh page would sign out.

FIX: I had to add the missing "defaults" at axiosDefaults.js for

```javascript
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true
```

___
BUG: Upload multiple images

FIX: I had to add had to set Array.from to formdata

```javascript
Array.from(imageInput.current.files).forEach((file) => {
      formData.append("uploaded_images", file);
    });
```

___
BUG: I couldn't deploy the project to Heroku

FIX: Had to set

```javascript
"engines": {

    "node": "16.20.2"

  } 
```

to package.json to be able to deploy the app
