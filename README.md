# CB Real Estate

![Home Page](documentation/features/Home.png)

CB Real Estate represents the culmination of my efforts during the final project for Code Institute, serving as a dynamic platform designed for further development and potential client adoption. Focused on real estate, the site empowers users to effortlessly search for their next home, office space, or the ideal plot of land for construction. The inclusion of user accounts allows individuals to curate a personalized wishlist, tracking properties of interest, and facilitating seamless communication through a user-friendly contact form. Currently, property uploads are restricted to administrators, ensuring quality control, but the future vision includes the possibility for registered agents to contribute their listings. As the project evolves, CB Real Estate aims to provide an enriched and intuitive platform for users to explore and engage with the real estate market.

### Deployment

The site has been deployed using Heroku. Deployed [API link](https://re-drf-api-f69fb4705742.herokuapp.com/).

I have used VSCode for developement so I'll describe the steps I took.

Follow these steps:

#### ElephantSQL

If you don't already have an account to ElephantSQL, create one [here](https://www.elephantsql.com).

* Create an external database with

  * Log into ElephantSQL
  * Click "Create New Instance"
  * Set up a plan by giving a Name and selecting a Plan
  * Click "Select Region" and choose a Data center
  * Click "Review", check all details and click "Create Instance"
  * Return to the Dashboard and click on the database instance name
  * Copy the database URL

* Create a new repository
* Clone the repository from VSCode
* In VSC open the terminal and install the following using the ```pip install``` command.

```text
'django<4'
django-cloudinary-storage==0.3.0
Pillow==8.2.0
djangorestframework
django-filter
dj-rest-auth
'dj-rest-auth[with_social]'
djangorestframework-simplejwt
dj_database_url psycopg2
gunicorn
django-cors-headers
```

* Create a Django project

```text
django-admin startproject project_name .
```

The site has been deployed using Heroku. Deployed site [CB Real Estate](https://re-real-estate-ecc213881132.herokuapp.com/). Follow these steps:

I have used VSCode with [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for developement so I'll describe the steps I took.

* Create the repository.
* On VScode connect to WSL.
  * Clone the repository
* Run the command ```npx create-react-app . --use-npm```
* After it has finished run the command ```npm start``` to check if the app is working.
* Git add, commit and push.

#### Add the Herolu deployment commands

In package.json file, in the “scripts” section, add the following prebuild command:

```"heroku-prebuild": "npm install -g serve",```

This will install a package needed to serve our single page application on heroku

Add a Procfile at the root of the project with the following web command:

```web: serve -s build```

#### Connect to the API

Navigate to the Heroku app of the project DRF-API, and under the Settings tab, add the following configvars:

|KEY|VALUE|
|--|--|
|CLIENT_ORIGIN | <https://your-react-app-name.herokuapp.com>*|
|CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV | <https://gitpod-browser-link.ws-eu54.gitpod.io>*|

*Check that the trailing slash \ at the end of both links has been removed.

#### Heroku App

If you don't already have an account to Heroku, create one [here](https://www.heroku.com/).

* Create Heroku app
  * Go to the Heroku dashboard and click the "Create new app" button.
  * Name the app. Each app name on Heroku has to be unique.
  * Then select your region.
  * And then click "Create app".

* In the IDE file explorer or terminal
  * Create new env.py file on top level directory

* In env.py
  * Import os library
  * Set environment variables
  * Add database url
  * Add in secret key

```python
import os

os.environ['DEV'] = '1'
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in ElephantSQL database URL"    
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"    
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "Paste in the API Environment variable"
```
  
If you don't already have an account to Cloudinary, create one [here](https://cloudinary.com/).

* Cloudinary
  * Go to the Cloudinary dashboard and copy the API Environment variable.
  * Paste in env.py variable CLOUDINARY_URL(see above)

* In settings.py and to the INSTALLED_APPS add :

```python
'cloudinary_storage',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'cloudinary',
'rest_framework',
'django_filters',
'rest_framework.authtoken',
'dj_rest_auth',
'django.contrib.sites',
'allauth',
'allauth.account',
'allauth.socialaccount',
'dj_rest_auth.registration',
'corsheaders',
```

* Import the database, the regular expression module & the env.py

```python
import dj_database_url
import re
import os
if os.path.exists('env.py')
    import env
Below the import statements, add the following variable for Cloudinary:
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.ger('CLOUDINARY_URL')
}

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinartStorage'
```

* Below INSTALLED_APPS, set site ID:

```python
SITE_ID = 1
```

* Below BASE_DIR, create the REST_FRAMEWORK, and include page pagination to improve app loading times, pagination count, and date/time format:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [(
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication'
        if 'DEV' in os.environ
        else 'dj_rest_auth.jwt_auth.JWTCookieAuthentication'
    )],
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':
        'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10,
    'DATETIME_FORMAT': '%d %b %Y',
}
```

* Set the default renderer to JSON:

```python
if 'DEV' not in os.environ:
    REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES'] = [
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
    ]
```

* Beneath that, add the following:

```python
REST_USE_JWT = True
JWT_AUTH_SECURE = True
JWT_AUTH_COOKIE = 'my-app-auth'
JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE = 'my-refresh-token'
JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None'
```

* Then add:

```python
REST_AUTH_SERIALIZERS = {
    'USER_DETAILS_SERIALIZER': 'project_name.serializers.CurrentUserSerializer'
}
```

* Update DEBUG variable to:

```python
DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ
```

* Update the DATABASES variable to:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': ({
       'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    } if 'DEV' in os.environ else dj_database_url.parse(
        os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
    )
    )
}
```

* Add the Heroku app to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable:

```python
os.environ.get('ALLOWED_HOST'),
'localhost',
```

* Below ALLOWED_HOST, add the CORS_ALLOWED variable:

```python
if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN' in os.environ:
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN')
    ]

if "CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV" in os.environ:
    extracted_url = re.match(
        r"^.+-", os.environ.get("CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV", ""), re.IGNORECASE
    )
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
        r"^http:\/\/localhost:*([0-9]+)?$",
    ]
```

* Also add to the top of MIDDLEWARE:

```python
'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
```

Final requirements:

* Create a Procfile, & add the following two lines:

```text
release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi
```

* Migrate the database:

```text
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

* Freeze requirements:

```text
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

* In heroku app
  * Go to the settings tab.
  * In the settings click the button "Reveal Config Vars".
  * Click Add and use

    |KEY|VALUE|
    |--|--|
    |DATABASE_URL|Paste in ElephantSQL database URL|
    |SECRET_KEY|Your own randomSecretKey|
    |CLOUDINARY_URL|Paste in the API Environment variable|
    |ALLOWED HOST|api-app-name.herokuapp.com|
    |CLIENT_ORIGIN | <https://your-react-app-name.herokuapp.com>*|
    |CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV | <https://gitpod-browser-link.ws-eu54.gitpod.io>*|

    *Check that the trailing slash \ at the end of both links has been removed.

* In heroku app
  * Go to the deploy tab.
  * Choose the deployment method.
  * Select Github, and confirm to connect to Github.
